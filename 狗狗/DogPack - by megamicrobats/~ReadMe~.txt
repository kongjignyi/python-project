Hi! Thank you so much for downloading this pack. This is my first asset pack I have uploaded to Itch.io, and your feedback would be greatly appreciated!
If you like this art, then sharing it or commenting on the Itch.io page would help a lot. Thanks!

Alongside the sprites and animations, I have included all of the original Aseprite files. Feel free to edit or tweak any sprite you'd like for your projects.

Please credit me if you use this in your game. Thank you and happy developing! ^-^
